## Brace expansion

   There are two types of list we can use inside this brace expansion 
  1) String lists
  2) Range lists
     echo {a,19,jan,sachin} here used without spaces

### RangeList
     echo{1..10} for simple giving printing list

     echo{1..10..2} for giving range with steps also
----
## Word Splitting
    Word splitting is a process performed by shell on the results of some of the expansions to seprate those results into
    seprate words.
